* To Do
** Terrain/Map
 - [ ] draw terrain features
   - perlin noise
** Path Finding
 - [ ] cost fields for permanent (terrain) features
 - [ ] account for unit width somehow, e.g. can't move diagonally if horizontal & vertical neighbours are impassable
   - cost fields could be per unit width
 - [ ] dynamically recalculate integration & flow fields as units move
   - flow fields could be lazily calculated - they only depend on the integration field
 - [ ] flow field directions should account for empty space i.e. more direct heading
   - see LOS (line of sight) Pass in Game AI Pro 23.6.2
 - [ ] expire old flow fields
** Interaction - Mouse/Keys
 - [ ] choose entity action depending on what is at pt e.g. attack vs move
 - [ ] mouse scroll to zoom
 - [ ] mouse click & drag to move around map
** Vehicle Commands
 - [ ] support different command types
 - [ ] patrol
 - [ ] attack
** Units
*** Buildings
 - [ ] power-station
 - [ ] mine
*** Vehicles
 - [ ] artillery
** Bugs
 - [ ] units can overshoot destination, especially for slow frame rates
 - [ ] clicking outside the map can crash the game
* Rear View
** DONE cost fields for dynamic (vehicles)
** DONE use flow fields for unit movement
 - lookup intermediate points en-route to command points
 - calculate flow fields on demand
 - units use flow field to move to next destination
** DONE use cost fields when calculating the integration field - don't just exclude them
** DONE proper isolation nav open & close states as a nav request
** DONE turn =nav-debug= in to an "overlay" i.e. independent from the notion of level
** DONE encapsulate access of =state.world.physics= in =core= & =nav=, =:getRect= & =:queryRect=
** DONE proper static cost field
 - not just some random cells
